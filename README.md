## Introduction

The Kivi VPN project is an open-source project that I developed a few weeks ago as a Flutter portfolio piece.

This app functions similarly to the Android version of v2rayNG, but with a different interface and additional features such as real-time configuration of IP addresses and connection speeds.

As I mentioned, this project is open-source and publicly available, although it may contain some bugs or shortcomings that I'll strive to improve over time.

In the following sections, I will provide some screenshots of the app's interface and its features.

## Home Screen Overview

The top section dynamically displays the connection duration, followed by your connected network's IP address, country, and flag.

Below, you'll find a series of sections, each represented by a distinct icon, which will be explained in detail shortly.

Next, you'll see a section that provides basic configuration details for the current connection, including the configuration name, address, and sent/received data.

Finally, you'll find the power button to connect or disconnect from the VPN.

## Speed Test

In this section, accessible from the home screen, you can measure the speed of your internet connection or the VPN you are connected to.

## Your Added Servers

Here, you'll find a complete list of all the VPN servers and configurations that you've added to the app. You have the flexibility to add new servers using either the clipboard or a QR code. Each server configuration offers various options, including the ability to test its ping, edit its settings, or remove it entirely from your device's local database.

## Configuration Editing

This page allows you to modify certain aspects of your configurations. Please note that this feature is currently under development and will be expanded in future updates.

## At The End

This project was created as a learning exercise. If you have any ideas on how to improve it, I'd love to hear your suggestions.
